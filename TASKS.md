# Combined Lab — Checklist

## Part A — make the security real (`app/main.py`)
- [x] **TASK 1 (A04)** hash_password / verify_password use bcrypt
- [x] **TASK 2 (A07)** create_token / read_token use a signed, expiring JWT
- [x] **TASK 3 (A07)** get_current_user raises 401 on a bad/expired token or unknown user (fail closed)
- [x] **TASK 4 (A01)** get_note returns 403 when the note isn't the caller's
- [x] **TASK 5 (A01)** /admin/users requires the admin role and never returns the password column

## Part B — write the tests (`tests/`)
API (`test_api.py`)
- [x] register then login returns a JWT (three dotted parts)
- [x] wrong password returns 401
- [x] create a note, then see it in your list

Security (`test_security.py`)
- [x] bad token rejected (401)
- [x] a user can't read another's note (403) — A01
- [x] a user can read their own note (200)
- [x] same login error for bad user vs bad password — A07
- [x] a non-admin can't list users (403) — A01
- [x] admin list has no password field — A04

**Goal:** all 5 tasks complete and all 11 tests passing (`pytest -q`). Then run `pytest --cov=app`.

## Reflection
I chose `test_user_cannot_read_another_users_note` as my security test. It logs in as Alice and tries to access a note that belongs to Bob. The expected 403 response checks for OWASP A01 Broken Access Control. If the ownership check were removed from `get_note`, Alice could read Bob's private note, and this test would fail.
